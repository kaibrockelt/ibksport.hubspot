# VTEX "just a Div"

## Description

When life gives you plenty of lemons, you better put them in a box to keep them organized.
The same can happen in development. Sometimes you just need a plain-stupid-simple wrapper div to get things going. 
That's why I've built the most useless but yet handy app in VTEX.

## Usage
First, install the app via VTEX Toolbelt. 

```bash
    vtex install vtex.just-a-div@0.x
```

To use this app, you need to import in your dependencies on `manifest.json`.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.just-a-div": "0.x"
  }
```

### How it works?
Whenever you need to wrap something in place without adding functionality on top, all you need is a plain div. Just add a new just-a-div block to your config and add the content you want to wrap as children.


### how it's used
The app only supports the very basics: 
* composition of children
* Block classes
* **NEW** - YES! The ID makes sense. Now you have it! Feel free to drop IDs starting at version 0.2.0 via the prop "htmlId"

```json
"just-a-div#aroundthelinks": {
  "props": {
    "blockClass": "linkWrapper",
    "htmlId": "look-mum-i-am-unique"
  },
  "children":[
	"content#1",
	"content#2",
	"...."
	]	
}
```


## CSS handles
The following CSS handles can be used for styling:

```js
  'justDiv'
```
